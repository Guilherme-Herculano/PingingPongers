# PingingPongers
This repository demonstrates concurrent programming in Go using channels. It features two functions, "ping" and "pong", that send messages to a channel, and a "print" function that receives and prints the messages to the screen. This creates a simple simulation of a production line where messages are alternately produced and displayed.
